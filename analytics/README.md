# Flurry API
This repo contains a python script that accesses CHPL app usage data via the Flurry API via their website https://y.flurry.com and associated API console. The script makes a query and converts the results to CSV so they can be used to create a dataset in the Open Data Portal here https://www.chapelhillopendata.org/explore/dataset/flurry/. This script is run daily and the dataset is updated shortly after.
